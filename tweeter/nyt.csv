Information that we collect using these technologies is combined with personal information about you. If we combine information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information."
"A) Device Information. We collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the NYT Services, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses (the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the Internet), geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information."

You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites, including NYTimes.com, if your computer does not accept cookies from us. Because there is no accepted standard on how to respond to “do not track” browser-based signals, we do not respond to such signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, and how to manage them for the applicable NYT Service, see the applicable Cookie Policy here."
"We transmit website usage information to third parties in order to show you advertising for The New York Times when you visit other sites.

If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information. The ads in our apps are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they are targeted to you based on your ZIP code or device's IP address."

For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the NYT Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests."

You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

1.1. Definitions
"The term ""digital product"" refers to paid digital products available from NYTimes, including both NYTimes digital subscriptions and one-time purchases."
1.2. About Digital Products
"You are not required to purchase anything for certain limited use of NYTimes.com or the NYTimes apps. However, if you do not purchase a subscription or product, your access to NYTimes content and services will be limited."
"You can review the various NYTimes digital subscriptions here. We also offer other products and services, such as crosswords, gift subscriptions, e-books and articles from our archive. The purchase of a gift subscription is a one-time purchase; for more information, see the Gift Subscriptions FAQ."
"The New York Times reserves the right to modify the content, type and availability of any digital product at any time."
Only one person may use the user name and password associated with a digital product account.
"For details about your purchases, including payment methods and billing cycles, visit the My Account area of NYTimes.com."
1.3. Processing and Payment
The New York Times will process your purchase as promptly as possible. There may be a delay in the activation of your product while payment details are verified.
"We accept major credit cards, PayPal and certain digital wallet services. We reserve the right to reject any order or purchase at any time."
"If your initial payment authorization is later revoked, your subscription, product or access will be terminated. Contact our Customer Care group if you believe your access was terminated in error."
"Unless specified otherwise in the Cancellation and Refund Policy, all charges are nonrefundable."
"To view or change your payment method, visit the My Account area of NYTimes.com."
1.4. Pricing
"When you purchase a digital product, the price will be made clear during the order process. You agree to pay the price that is stated at the time of your order, as well as any applicable taxes. You also agree to the billing frequency stated at the time of your order."
Discount eligibility is determined at the time of the order. Discounts cannot be applied retroactively.
"All prices are in United States Dollars, unless otherwise stated."
The New York Times reserves the right to change prices and fees at any time. We will notify you in advance if the regular rate of a product changes from what was stated at the time of your order. You will have the opportunity to accept the new price or cancel your subscription or purchase from that point forward.
Applicable taxes may vary. We are not able to notify you in advance of changes in applicable taxes.
"If a stated price is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the product at that price. We will notify you of the error and give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made."
Additional Costs
"Your subscription may not include access to all areas of the digital product, and you may have to pay additional fees for full access. These additional charges will be clearly stated."
"When you use your digital product, you may incur other additional charges from third party service providers, such as telecommunications fees, data fees or service provider fees. You are responsible for paying any additional charges."
"If you believe someone else has used your account or you are being charged for a product you do not have, please contact our Customer Care group."
1.5. Billing
1.5.1. Billing of Digital Subscriptions
"We will charge or debit your payment method at the beginning of your subscription or, if applicable, at the end of your free trial period. Billing will continue according to the cycle stated at the time of your order."
"To view information about your billing cycle, visit the My Account area of NYTimes.com."
"All NYTimes digital subscriptions are renewed automatically. When we renew your subscription, we will use the payment method currently associated with your account. If you redeem a gift subscription and choose to extend your subscription at the time of redemption, that subscription will renew automatically. You can view your payment method at any time in the My Account area of NYTimes.com."
"In most cases, you will not be notified in advance of impending renewals and you expressly agree to waive the application of New York General Obligations Law section 5-903 and any similar laws. Please see our Cancellation and Refund policy below for information about canceling."
1.5.2. Billing of One-Time Purchases
"When you make a one-time purchase (for example, a subscription sponsorship or standalone product such as an article from our archives or a gift subscription), we will charge or debit your payment method at the time of purchase."
1.5.3. Currency
The currency in which you will be billed will be stated during the purchase process and is determined based on your billing address.
1.6. Unpaid Charges
"If your credit card expires or your payment method is otherwise invalid, your subscription or product will not automatically be terminated. You will remain responsible for all charges."
"You will be responsible for all costs we incur in connection with the collection of unpaid amounts, including court costs, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees and any other associated costs."
1.7. Promotions
We may occasionally offer promotions. The specific terms of each promotion are stated at the time the promotion is offered. Each promotion may be different. Promotions cannot be combined.
"You are required to provide your payment details when you sign up for a promotion. At the end of the promotion, your subscription will automatically renew at the rates displayed at the time of purchase."
"We will not notify you in advance that the promotion is about to end and we will not notify you when your promotional rate has ended. To cancel and avoid being charged, you must notify us before the promotion ends."

Cancellations are effective the following billing cycle. You will not receive a refund for the current billing cycle. You will continue to have the same access and benefits of your product for the remainder of the current billing period.
